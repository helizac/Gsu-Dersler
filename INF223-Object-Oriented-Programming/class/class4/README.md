# Inheritance

### Reasons For the Existence of Inheritance

<hr>

- The set / subset relations required for the entities that we think exist in real life should also have a counterpart in object-oriented programming.
- It is advantageous to write a new class using an existing class. There is no code duplication and it is much easier to implement the project.
- We get the chance to develop the project based on classes that are in better condition.
- Inheritance is mandatory for polymorphism.
- It makes updating and upgrading the project very easy.
